    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        Factorio is a factory building game in which the player starts on an alien planet stranded after their ship
        crashed. The player must then gather resources in an attempt to escape the planet. The game was in development
        from 2012 and version 1.0 was released on Aug 14, 2020. The developers are committed to keeping the game price
        at $30.00USD and have neither raised nor lowered the price since its inception.
    </p>
    <p>
        The game is designed for players to build large, interconnected factories, in order to create increasingly
        complex parts which are required for technological advancement. Each map seed is entirely unique and yields of
        trees, iron, copper, oil, and uranium will vary, creating a unique experience for every playthrough.

        The player will be forced to optimize production lines, expand to find more resources, and fight the alien
        inhabitants as their factory expands in size in order to escape the new world. On the next few pages Iâ€™ll
        provide a synopsis on what makes such a simple sounding game so captivating to many.
