        The process of optimizing each aspect of the assembly line can easily occupy hundreds of hours of playtime,
        culminating with the end goal of producing the expensive components required to build the rocket, which is the
        official end-goal of the game.

        By this time, the planet no longer resembles what it once did. The once lush trees surrounding the player are
        bare, the previously blue waterways take on a greenish hue, and the landscape is covered in impermeable
        concrete. One could even argue that the game acts as an allegory to real world issues.

        Once the player amasses the required components, a dramatic cutscene of a rocket launch is cut off abruptly by a
        list of statistics gathered over the course of the game. Game duration, number of components produced, amount of
        pollution created, and number of components crafted by hand are all displayed to the player. This simple screen
        only adds to the already magnificent replayability of the game as it gives the player goals for future
        playthroughs, whether it be a speed-run or not crafting a single component by hand the entire time.</p>
