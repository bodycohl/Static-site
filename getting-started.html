    <h1>Getting Started</h1>
    <p>
        After venturing out from their crashed ship, the player will first need to gather iron, copper, and wood by
        hand. This process is very time consuming and inefficient but allows the player to craft improved tools for
        gathering materials which harvest faster. After gathering a surplus of combustible fuel and enough iron, the
        player can create a coal power drill which can mine resources automatically. Naturally, the player will place
        these on all the basic resource deposits, massively increasing their productivity.
    </p>
    <p>
        This allows the player to simply top off the coal on the drills and collect the resources gathered. Once the raw
        materials are gathered, the player can refine them in coal powered furnaces, which again allows them to craft
        better tools and machinery.
    </p>

        It is at this point that the player will run into the main adversity to advancement: bottlenecking. As the
        number of drills increases, the player will have to tend to more of them. At first this can be alleviated with
        the use of storage buffers such as crates, which will store excess resources for the inputs and outputs, but
        this solution rapidly becomes unsustainable. This gameplay mechanic will transcend every technological evolution
        the player goes through and creates a different plot depending on how the player remedies the issue.
