    <h1>Automation</h1>
    <p>
        After manually feeding the increasing number of machines, the player will realize that centralized electrical
        power production is the only way to continue. After setting up a series of coal powered boilers and steam
        engines, mindless tasks can begin to be automated with inserters, which can both store and remove items from
        machines and buffers. This series of adding more machines to create a complex, interconnected network is what
        makes this game both appealing and addicting for many players.

        From this point, the player can delve into refining oil and transporting resources by conveyor belts, fluid
        conduits, trucks, and even programmable trains complete with working rail signals and logic. As the factory
        expands and pollution accumulates, the player is challenged with regular attacks by the alien inhabitants which
        can be thwarted with anything from flamethrowers to atomic weapons and automated laser turrets. This naturally
        leads to the development of cleaner power sources such as nuclear reactors which can only be operated after a
        complex uranium enrichment process.
