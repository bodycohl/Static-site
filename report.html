    <h1>Report</h1>
    <p>
        My site serves as a game review that is targeted towards consumers of videogames. All of my images are from the
        Factorio wiki with credit given in the caption and with alternate text. My navbar contains five pages, each
        containing a header, covering different stages of gameplay and the report. All pages pass Nu Validator. All
        pages share the same style sheet, and the text is displayed properly on mobile screens. The contact form on the
        final page is not yet functional. A link is included to the official site on the main page. All subdomains are
        also under https.
